# AccessAudit installer
#  1. obtains an immudb container
#  2. create a database called 'audit' in it
#  3. adds to rsylog.conf a line that makes all logs be *also* logged in the audit database
#  4. provides query tool

# v0.1 Humble beginnings
# v0.2 Rough outline done. Refined visuals
# v0.3 Sanity checks

# This is the command we will use when we need superuser privileges. It is
# exported so scripts we call will also use this value. If you use "doas" you
# may change it here.
